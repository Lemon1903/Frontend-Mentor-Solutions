## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](tailwindcss.com) - Utility-first CSS Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/tutorials/quick-start) - JS Library for state management

### What I learned

- Learned React Redux basics and used it in this project for managing states. Overall, it is easy to understand but it has added boilerplate to start with. It is a great library for managing global states used throughout the whole app and a good alternative to context and reducer hook of react.

### Continued development

- Master React and know other useful libraries to be used in React.
- Learn Next.js for added knowledge and experience.
- Folder structuring in React.
- Try to add some animations with these project to look more interactive.

### Useful resources

- [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/tutorials/quick-start) - A library for managing states throughout your application. This is a documentation to get you started using it with React.
