## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- Typescript
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

Add animation on scroll and also some cool effects if possible.

### Useful resources

- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - I copied and tweaked two of the components named Tabs and Accordion that are already designed and accessible here.
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) - I used the API reference here since shadcn/ui uses it for accessibility concerns.
