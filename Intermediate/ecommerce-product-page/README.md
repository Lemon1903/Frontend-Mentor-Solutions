## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML
- Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, autoprefixer
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- I learned a lot and to summarize, I learned React and Tailwind in which I use them with this challenge. It was fun learning and applying those in this challenge.
- Main concepts learned in React was components, props, managing states with `useReducer` and `useState`, using context API, and more!
- Managed to used Tailwind which made the designing a lot faster and easier with the utilities.

### Continued development

- More practice with React concepts and master them.
- Maybe learn Next.js too for full-stack or even just the frontend. It can be a huge asset to be in my toolbelt.
- Maybe I can continue my Django journey and connect it with these frameworks

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - It contains eveything you need to know in tailwind.
