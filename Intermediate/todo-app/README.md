## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS Framework
- [Framer-Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - A production-ready motion library for React

### What I learned

- Basics of framer-motion to get started in using it in this app which is a great library for creating amazing animations easily. I used it mainly on:
  - reordering todo items
  - removing and adding todo items
  - animating the empty message base on the number of todo items
- Drag and drop API in HTML and JavaScript but wasn't able to do it here due to using framer-motion.

### Continued development

- Learn more about framer-motion and how to create more basic animations with it.
- Hone folder structuring in React and also when to actually separate a JSX code into a component.
- Hone knowledge regarding using Context API for state management.
