## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox and Grid

### What I learned

- Got more comfortable on using utility classes, custom properties, and flexbox and grid layouts.
- I learned a little bit about positiong for the image overlay.

```css
.image-container {
  position: relative;
}

.img-overlay {
  justify-content: center;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  ...;
}
```

### Continued development

- Need to know more on responsiveness and get comfortable with it.
- Need to learn position more and get comfortable with it.
- Need to know more on handling images and svgs.
- Not rely too much on magic numbers for sizes.
