## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox and Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Getting comfortable with semantic HTML and CSS properties and custom properties, and also styling with vanilla CSS.

### Continued development

I want to learn more on CSS like the selectors, animation, media query, container query and more advanced concepts of CSS while also strengthening my knowledge in its basics and fundamentals. It also applies in HTML and hopefully touch the Javascript next.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Reference](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helps me easily lookup the properties of CSS Grid and a valuable reference to use.
- [Quick Guide on CSS Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiNiSFIPIQE&t=415s) - This helped me a lot on understanding the grid layout in CSS. It taught me how to use it and what properties and shortcuts I could do with CSS Grid layout.
