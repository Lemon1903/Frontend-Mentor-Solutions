## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox and Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) - A CSS Preprocessor

### What I learned

- First tried out SCSS, a CSS preprocessor which is recommended by many and was also known as "CSS with superpowers". Basically it made the code cleaner and smaller which is very efficient rather than writing vanilla CSS only.
- Learned more about animation in CSS.

### Continued development

- Get more familiar with SCSS/SASS preprocessors and become comfortable using it from now on.
- Writing clean and organized code with SCSS.
